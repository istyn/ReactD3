Simple reactive dashboard displays JSON data in a bar chart. Total count and average value are displayed. <br/>
Coded in React.JS and D3 v5. <br/>
Demo is found at http://lamp.istyles.net/~istyles6<br/>

This dashboard based off code from the following tutorials:<br>
Chart and Axes from: https://medium.com/@caspg/responsive-chart-with-react-and-d3v4-afd717e57583
Stats bar from: https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/interactive-applications-with-react-d3-f76f7b3ebc71

Challenges with combining React + D3 in this way:
   *Both frameworks render, which eliminates any transitions.
   *React doesn't manage data.

Future work:
   *Retrieve JSON data asynchronously
   *React to pass data between Components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
